     'Aeschynanthus Radicans, more commonly known as lipstick plant, is a popular and striking evergreen tropical houseplant.
     It gets its name from the vibrant red and tubular flowers that appear above a burgundy bud. These flowers grow in clusters and, along
      with the waxy, glossy, green foliage, have a cascading, vine-like habit. This makes them an ideal choice for use in hanging baskets or tall
      containers.
     As an epiphytic species, these plants are native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Here you will find them growing on tree branches
      and in crevices in rocks.
     Provided they get adequate heat, humidity, and filtered sunlight, you can enjoy abundant blooms for much of the year. In general, however,
      lipstick plants flower most profusely in summer and autumn.','http://www.plantasonya.com.br/wp-content/img/Aeschynanthun-pulcher.jpg')

      visually stunning throughout all stages of their growth, they are considered a slow-growing fern, typically taking up to three years to reach their
      full mature size. Plant the fern outdoors any time during the year if you live in the right USDA zone where theyll thrive.',
